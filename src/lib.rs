/*!
`diesel-tracing` provides connection structures that can be used as drop in
replacements for diesel connections with extra tracing and logging.

Usage should be straightforward if you are already using dynamic trait objects
or impl trait for your connections. For example a function such as:

```
fn use_connection(
    conn: &impl diesel::Connection<Backend = diesel::pg::Pg>,
) -> () {}
```

Will accept both `diesel::PgConnection` and the `InstrumentedPgConnection`
provided by this crate and this works similarly for other implementations
of `Connection` if you change the parametized Backend marker in the
function signature.

Unfortunately there are some methods specific to backends which are not
encapsulated by the `diesel::Connection` trait, so in those places it is
likely that you will just need to replace your connection type with the
Instrumented version.

# Usage

Just like diesel this crate relies on some feature flags to specify which
database driver to support. Just as in diesel configure this in your
`Cargo.toml`

```toml
[dependencies]
diesel-tracing = { version = "<version>", features = ["<postgres|mysql|sqlite>"] }
```

# Notes

## Fields

Currently the few fields that are recorded are a subset of the `OpenTelemetry`
semantic conventions for [databases](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/master/specification/trace/semantic_conventions/database.md).
This was chosen for compatibility with the `tracing-opentelemetry` crate, but
if it makes sense for other standards to be available this could be set by
feature flag later.

It would be quite useful to be able to parse connection strings to be able
to provide more information, but this may be difficult if it requires use of
diesel feature flags by default to access the underlying C bindings.

## Levels

All logged traces are currently set to DEBUG level, potentially this could be
changed to a different default or set to be configured by feature flags. At
them moment this crate is quite new and it's unclear what a sensible default
would be.

## Errors

Errors in Result objects returned by methods on the connection should be
automatically logged through the `err` directive in the `instrument` macro.

## Sensitive Information

As statements may contain sensitive information they are currently not recorded
explicitly, pending finding a way to filter things intelligently.

Similarly connection strings are not recorded in spans as they may contain
passwords

## TODO

- [ ] Record and log connection information (filtering out sensitive fields)
- [ ] Provide a way of filtering statements, maybe based on regex?
